## About Aperture Portfolio Prize

The purpose of the Aperture Portfolio Prize is to identify high-quality work by
new voices in contemporary photography. When choosing the first-prize winner and
runners-up, Aperture’s editorial and curatorial staff look for innovative bodies
of work that haven’t been widely seen in major publications or exhibition venues.

## What winners receive

The first-prize winner will be published in Aperture magazine and will receive a 
$3,000 cash prize along with an exhibition at Aperture Gallery and Bookstore in
New York. Additionally, the winner and up to four runners-up will be featured in
an online gallery on aperture.org. All finalists are announced in the foundation’s 
e-newsletter, which reaches over fifty thousand subscribers across the globe, including
curators, critics, and members of the photography community. The winner and runners-up
may also have an opportunity to participate in Aperture Foundation’s limited-edition print program.
