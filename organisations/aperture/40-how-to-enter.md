# Judging criteria

When reviewing entries, Aperture’s editors and curatorial staff consider the following criteria:

- Is the work new, i.e., created in the last five years?
- Is a theme or topic carried throughout the portfolio in a consistent manner?
- Do individual images have strong composition, strong use of color or tone etc.?
- What technical and presentation choices has the photographer made, and are they appropriate for the work?
  For example, is there a clear reason for the work being black-and-white versus a digitally enhanced palette?
- Does the body of work take an innovative or unique approach to the subject matter?
